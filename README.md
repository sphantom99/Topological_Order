# Topological_Order

The dag.c is a small programm that can create Directed Acyclic Graphs in a specific format to be used for the parallel_khan.c program

The parallel_khan.c programm is my implementation of Khan's algorithm for finding a topological order of a DAG while utilising the openmp suite for parallel processing.
